# EI.To-Do
I have created a simple To-Do List Manager using java where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete, view all tasks or filter them based on their completion status.

## Key Features
- Add tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- View tasks or filter them based on their completion status:
  - All tasks
  - Completed tasks
  - Pending tasks

## Key Focus
1. `Behavioral Pattern:` Undo and redo actions using the Memento pattern.
2. `Creational Pattern:` Used the Builder Pattern for constructing tasks with optional attributes like due date or tags.
3. `OOP:` Focused on encapsulation by keeping task data and methods together in a class.
